## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-4o` as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to with just a few lines of code.


## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables `.env` to run Chatbot, a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
